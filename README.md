This project aims to demonstrate the process of utilizing NLP techniques to transform data related to text into tensors. In addition, this project also focuses on implementing models and comparing the accuracy of the predictions they make on a testing dataset made from the train-test split method.

**I will add more models that highlight and demonstrate higher accuracy in making predictions than the models created for this project. Furthermore, it also focuses on improving the models designed for this project due to having low results for predictions made**
